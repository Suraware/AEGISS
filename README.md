AEGIS Sentinel — Global Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform

1. Problem it solves
Security teams globally are drowning in generic threat feeds with no context for their specific industry, region, or technology stack. Analysts waste hours manually correlating CVEs, APT campaigns, and IOCs across dozens of disconnected sources with no unified view of what actually threatens them.

2. What it does
A tool that aggregates live threat intelligence from MITRE ATT&CK, NVD, CISA KEV, AlienVault OTX, Abuse.ch, and ransomware trackers, normalizes everything into a single database, and scores every threat against the analyst's configured industry, region, and technology stack so they see prioritized, actionable intelligence instead of raw noise.

3. Who it is for
SOC analysts, threat intelligence teams, CISOs, penetration testers, government CERTs, university cybersecurity programs, and any organization that needs to understand their threat landscape without a six-figure Recorded Future subscription.

4. Why it is valuable
Enterprise threat intelligence platforms like Recorded Future, CrowdStrike, and Mandiant cost tens of thousands of dollars annually. AEGIS delivers the core workflow — aggregate, correlate, prioritize, report — completely free and open source, with no vendor lock-in and full offline capability after initial sync.

5. Quick to deploy
Single pip install. Runs on any laptop or server. SQLite local database with optional PostgreSQL for team deployments. No cloud dependency, no agents, no infrastructure. Fully operational in under 2 minutes with `pip install aegis-sentinel && aegis config setup`.

6. Easy to demo
Run aegis dashboard and a live terminal shows global threat activity in real time. Run aegis ioc check on a malicious IP live on stage and instantly return reputation data from five sources simultaneously. Generate an industry-specific threat briefing in one command showing a formatted PDF output ready to hand to a CISO.

7. Easy to build in 24 hours
Every data source is a free public API requiring no approval or payment. Python with Typer and Rich produces a professional terminal interface with minimal code. The core pipeline — fetch, normalize, score, display — is achievable in 6 hours leaving 18 hours to build the context engine, reporting, and IOC management.

8. Real world impact
The global average cost of a data breach in 2024 was $4.88 million according to IBM. Most breaches exploit known vulnerabilities that had patches available. AEGIS Sentinel exists to close that gap — giving any security team regardless of budget the intelligence they need to patch the right things first, detect threats earlier, and respond faster. It is a genuine open-source contribution to the global security community, not a hackathon prototype.
